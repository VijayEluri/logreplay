README for haproxy-log-replay-tool

BUILDING

    ]$ ant package

INSTALLATION

The ant deploy.* targets install the system into /opt/logreplay.  Configuration
files will be deployed to /opt/logreplay/haproxy-log-replay-tool/src/resources/.
Scripts will be installed to /opt/logreplay/haproxy-log-replay-tool/src/bin/.

To install the system with a simple configuration file enabling you to replay 
an existing haproxy log:

    ]$ ant deploy.development 

The configuration file installed by deploy.development will enable the replayer
to consume a single log file called  
/opt/logreplay/haproxy-log-replay-tool/logs/haproxy.log

To install the system with a configuration suitable for "tailing" the files in 
a directory as they are created (e.g. to consume the output of something like 
the Facebook Scribe log aggregating server):

    ]$ ant deploy.production

RUNNING

The simplest case is just to point the system at an existing haproxy log file and replay the entire file.

    ]$ ant package
    ]$ ant deploy.development
    ]$ (cd /opt/logreplay; sh ./src/bin/run.sh)

The deploy.production configuration requires jnotify to be installed.
(for windows, jnotify.dll needs to be copied into a directory referenced by the 
PATH env var)
 
HAPROXY CONFIG

The default haproxy log parser assumes a configuration which captures Referer, 
User-Agent, and X-Forwarded-For.  E.g.:

    frontend leads-http-fe
        bind            *:80
        mode            http
        log             global
        option          httplog
        option          dontlognull
        option          httpclose
        option          forwardfor
        clitimeout      30000
        default_backend my--http-be

        capture request header Referer         len 192
        capture request header User-Agent      len 128
        capture request header X-Forwarded-For len 192
